# Object-Recog-Fashion-Mnist
Basic object recognition in fashion mnist data.  

# Fashion Mnist 
Is a ten class dataset of shoes and clothing.  
It is available on kaggle at  
https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist  

# CNN  
I made a convolutional neural network classifier that  
achieves about 91 percent accuracy on the validation set.  
It has three CNN layers and one fully connected softmax layer with  
ten outputs corresponding the probability of the input belonging  
to a certain class. I used ReLU activation function in all of the  
CNN layers, as it is the most popular today.  

# Outputs
The program has already been run and it has ouput  
the training and test metrics accross the 15 epochs.  
I also included a graph of the training and test accuracies  
accross the epochs as well.
